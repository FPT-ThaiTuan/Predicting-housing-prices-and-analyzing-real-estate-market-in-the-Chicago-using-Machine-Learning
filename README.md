## **ABSTRACT: This project aims to predict house prices using the Chicago house price dataset, featuring attributes such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and tax values. Two predictive models were applied: RandomForestRegressor, which captures complex patterns, and Linear Regression, a simpler and more interpretable approach. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics. The Random Forest Regressor achieved an MSE of 9.70 and an R² of 0.95, indicating high accuracy and a strong fit to the data. Linear Regression had an MSE of 57.58 and an R² of 0.70, indicating weaker performance on complex data. As expected, the Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression, while Linear Regression provided faster and more interpretable results. This analysis highlights how different algorithms can be leveraged for real-world predictions in real estate, balancing accuracy and interpretability.**

### **Steps:**
### **1. Read the File: Load the Chicago house price dataset.**
### **2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, handling missing values and transforming features as needed.**
### **3. Feature Correlation Visualization: Display a graph to show the correlation among features to understand their relationships and potential impacts on the target variable.**
### **4. Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.**
### **5. Model Selection: Train both Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression models, selecting the best fit for our purpose.**
### **6. Display and Compare Results: Evaluate model performance using MSE and R², and compare the results for insights into accuracy and interpretability.**
